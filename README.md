# JavaScript Null vs Undefined in addition
This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript related to handling `null` and `undefined` values in arithmetic operations.

The `bug.js` file contains a function that correctly handles `null` values but fails to handle `undefined` values, resulting in a `TypeError`. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the function that gracefully handles both `null` and `undefined` values.

## Running the code
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.js` and `bugSolution.js` in a JavaScript environment.
3. Run the functions with different inputs to observe the behavior.

## Learning points
- Understanding the difference between `null` and `undefined` in JavaScript.
- Handling `null` and `undefined` values gracefully in arithmetic operations to prevent runtime errors.
